The Rust toolchain provided by BinaryBuilder can be requested by adding `:rust` to the `compilers` keyword argument to [`build_tarballs`](@ref): `compilers=[:c, :rust]`.  Rust-based packages can usually be built with `cargo`:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

The Rust toolchain provided by BinaryBuilder automatically selects the appropriate target and number of parallel jobs to be used.  Note, however, that you may have to manually install the product in the `${prefix}`.  Read the installation instructions of the package in case they recommend a different build procedure.

Example of packages using Rust:"""
    txts, codes = splitMDtext(txt)
    @test length(txts) == 5 && length(codes) == 1
    @test_throws ArgumentError splitMDtext(txt * "\n```")
end

@testset "Export temp files from markdown" begin
    file = (@__DIR__) * "/testcases/builder_index.md"
    mds2temp(file)
    txt = read(file, String)
    @test isfile("temp.xlsx") && isfile("temp.txt")
    @test length(getcodes(read("temp.txt", String))) == count("```", txt) รท 2
